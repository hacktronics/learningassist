    "<p>To find the GCF of \\(18\\) and \\(30\\), you can write their prime factorizations:</p>",

    "<p>Find the least common multiple of \\(10\\) and \\(27\\).</p>",
    "<p>\\(10\\) and \\(27\\) share no common factors other than \\(1\\). So, the GCF is \\(1\\).</p>",
    "<p>Therefore, the LCM is simply \\(10&#x22C5;27=270\\).</p>",
    "<p>A third way to find the LCM of is to list all of the prime factors of each number and then multiply all of the factors the greatest number of times each occurs in any of the lists.

    "<p>\\(60=2&#x22C5;2&#x22C5;3&#x22C5;5\\)</p>",
    "<p>The greatest number of times the factor \\(2\\) occurs is four (in the first list). </p>",
    "<p>The greatest number of times the factor \\(3\\) occurs is one (in the third list). </p>",
    "<p>The greatest number of times the factor \\(5\\) occurs is two (in the second list). </p>",
